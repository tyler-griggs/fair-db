* Remove assumption of 2 clients in codebase
* Move logic out of main into the manager. Main should just be parameters
  and manager should be responsible for setting up the db
* Restructure how queues and mutexes are managed. Create a single object
  for all queues and state of a given resource
* Clean up analysis scripts. Create 1) per-client timeseries, 2) per-
  worker timeseries
* Workers should log to different streams, merge them for display
* Update makefile to recompile when headers are changed
* Add queue in front of system
* Collect stats in more efficient data structure
